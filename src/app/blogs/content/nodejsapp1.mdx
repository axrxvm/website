## You said you wanna build a Node.js app?

Perfect. Grab a coffee or chai ☕ and let’s get you started with your **first real Node.js application**.  
This ain’t no boring textbook tutorial — I’ll walk you through **step-by-chaotic-step** to build a small but working server.

We’ll be making a tiny Notes API — nothing fancy, but enough to flex on your dev friends 💪

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Project 📦

First, make a new folder and open it in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir notes-api
cd notes-api
npm init -y
```

Boom — you just created a Node.js project.

---

## Step 2: Create your main file 🧠

Make a file called `index.js`:

```bash
touch index.js
```

Open it up and add this:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

  if (req.url === "/notes" && req.method === "GET") {
    res.end(JSON.stringify([{ id: 1, text: "Learn Node.js" }]));
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Not Found" }));
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

Okay, okay. Breathe. You just built a server with Node’s built-in `http` module — *no frameworks*. You’re raw like that 🔥

---

## Step 3: Run it like a boss 👑

In your terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/notes](http://localhost:3000/notes)  
You should see this:

```json
[{ "id": 1, "text": "Learn Node.js" }]
```

Ayoo it’s working! 🎉

---

## Step 4: Add POST request support 📨

Let’s allow users to add new notes.

Update your `index.js` like this:

```js
let notes = [{ id: 1, text: "Learn Node.js" }];

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

  if (req.url === "/notes" && req.method === "GET") {
    res.end(JSON.stringify(notes));
  } else if (req.url === "/notes" && req.method === "POST") {
    let body = "";

    req.on("data", (chunk) => {
      body += chunk.toString();
    });

    req.on("end", () => {
      const newNote = JSON.parse(body);
      newNote.id = notes.length + 1;
      notes.push(newNote);

      res.statusCode = 201;
      res.end(JSON.stringify(newNote));
    });
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Not Found" }));
  }
});
```

Now use something like **Postman** or **curl** to send a `POST` request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/notes \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "Learn Express next"}'
```

And bam — you’ve got a POST API now. You’re officially dangerous 😈

---

## Step 5: Add nodemon for dev speed ⚡

Install nodemon:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Then in `package.json`, update scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

Now run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server auto-restarts on changes. Sweet.

---

## Step 6: (Optional but cool) Add CORS support 🛡️

If you're connecting from a frontend, you’ll probs need CORS:

```bash
npm install cors
```

(But wait — you're not using Express yet? Oh right. So skip this for now or move to Express when you’re ready.)

---

## Final folder structure 🗂️

```
notes-api/
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
```

Simple. Minimal. Noice.

## What You Just Did 🎯

- Set up a Node.js project ✅
- Built a working HTTP server ✅
- Made GET and POST endpoints ✅
- Learned to handle JSON manually ✅
- Became slightly cooler than 10 mins ago ✅

---

## Where to Go From Here 🚀

- Add file-based storage with `fs` module
- Use Express.js to simplify your code
- Hook it up with a frontend (React/Vue)
- Deploy it to a platform like Railway, Vercel, or Render

And yeah — keep playing, keep breaking stuff, and keep learning. You got this.
